# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released, and participants are challenged to solve it using their programming skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each day's challenge has its own folder, containing the puzzle input and my solution code. Additionally, there may be a README.md file in each day's folder with additional notes or explanations.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you'll need to have the required programming language and dependencies installed. Instructions for running each solution can be found in the respective day's folder.
